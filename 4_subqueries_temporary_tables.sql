-- ### Subquery
SELECT channel, AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at)AS day, channel
        COUNT(*)AS event_count
    FROM web_events_full
    GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Questions: Subquery

-- First, we needed to group by the day and channel. Then ordering by the number of events (the third column) gave us a quick way to answer the first question.
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
   channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

-- Now create a subquery tha simply provides all of the data from your first query
-- Here you can see that to get the entire table in question 1 back, we included an * in our SELECT statement. You will need to be sure to alias your table.
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
           channel, COUNT(*) as events
     FROM web_events 
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;

-- Now find the average number of events fro each channel. Since you broke out by day earlier, this is giving you an average perday.
-- Finally, here we are able to get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.
-- SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- ### Subquery Formating
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
                channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2
      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;

-- Additionally, if we have a GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, HAVING, or any other statement following our subquery, we would then indent it at the same level as our outer query.

-- The query below is similar to the above, but it is applying additional statements to the outer query, so you can see there are GROUP BY and ORDER BY statements used on the output are not tabbed. The inner query GROUP BY and ORDER BY statements are indented to match the inner table.

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
                channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2
      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub
GROUP BY day, channel, events
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- ### More On Subqueries
-- Orders that occurred on the same month as the first order ever
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) AS min_month
FROM orders)
ORDER BY occurred_at;

-- Questions: More On Subqueries

-- Use DATE_TRUNC to pull month level information about the first order ever placed in the orders table.
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) 
FROM orders;

-- Use the result of the previous query to find only the orders that took place in the same month and year as the first order, and then pull the average for each type of paper qty in this month
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) avg_std, AVG(gloss_qty) avg_gls, AVG(poster_qty) avg_pst
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
     (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
      (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);


-- More Subqueries Quizzes
-- Above is the ERD for the database again - it might come in handy as you tackle the quizzes below. You should write your solution as a subquery or subqueries, not by finding one solution and copying the output. The importance of this is that it allows your query to be dynamic in answering the question - even if the data changes, you still arrive at the right answer.
